# Team Flight Risk — CSC316 Project

A visual exploration of where, when, and why aviation incidents occur.

### Run the visualization locally

**Using Python HTTP server:**

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

**Note:** You cannot open `index.html` directly in the browser because of CORS restrictions when loading CSV files. Use a local server.

This CSC316 project is for educational purposes. The dataset is from Kaggle and subject to their terms of use.

AI was used for error handling and D3 best practices.
