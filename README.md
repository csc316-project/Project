# Plane Crashes Heat Map - D3 Globe Visualization

A dynamic, interactive heat map visualization of historical plane crashes displayed on a 3D globe using D3.js. The globe is integrated in the main project under the section **"Where do planes crash?"**.

### Run the visualization locally

**Using Python HTTP server:**

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

**Note:** You cannot open `index.html` directly in the browser because of CORS restrictions when loading CSV files. Use a local server.
